# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual representation of a digital interface. It outlines the basic structure and layout of a website, application, or software product without focusing on visual design elements such as colors, fonts, or images.
Wireframes typically include key components like headers, navigation menus, buttons, and content sections. They help teams visualize how users will interact with a product and how information will be organized.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing is a critical step in the UI/UX design process because it:

- Clarifies the structure and functionality of a product early in the design phase.
- Helps designers and stakeholders focus on user experience without distraction from styling.
- Enables quick feedback and iteration before high-fidelity designs or development begin.
- Improves communication among designers, developers, and product teams.
- Identifies usability issues and potential improvements early on.

Wireframes serve as a foundation for building user-friendly and functional interfaces by providing a clear and organized layout before advancing to full prototypes or final development.
